# angulauth

This project is generated with [yo angular generator](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-angular)
version 0.12.1.

## This Project was a solo project that I worked on while at MakerSquare. My deadline for the project (start to finish) was 36hrs. I initially had the intention to make this into a much bigger project, but ended up cutting the scope many times. This lead to the name on the title page of the app "Scope Cutter". Enjoy!

## Build & development

Run `grunt` for building and `grunt serve` for preview.

## Testing

Running `grunt test` will run the unit tests with karma.

## Requirements

-- Allow user to login with Twitter, GitHub and Facebook.
-- Once Logged in, user will be able to interact with data that comes from one of their three social login accounts.
